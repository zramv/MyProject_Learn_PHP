    <p><strong>A quintessential Mexican street food, tacos consist of a corn or wheat tortilla folded or rolled around a flavorful filling, with beef being a popular choice.</strong></p>

    <h3>Origin &amp; History:</h3>
    <p>Tacos have a long history in Mexico, predating European arrival. The indigenous people of the Valley of Mexico traditionally ate corn tortillas with fillings. The modern taco has evolved with various regional influences and ingredients.</p>

    <h3>Typical Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>For the Beef Filling:</strong> Ground beef or shredded beef (like barbacoa or carne asada). Spices can include chili powder, cumin, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano.</li>
        <li><strong>Tortillas:</strong> Corn or flour tortillas (small "street taco" size or larger).</li>
        <li><strong>Toppings (vary widely):</strong> Diced onion, chopped cilantro, salsa (roja, verde, pico de gallo), shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, shredded cheese (like cotija, queso fresco, or cheddar), sour cream or Mexican crema, guacamole, lime wedges.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preparation Summary:</h3>
    <p>For ground beef tacos, the beef is browned with onions and garlic, then simmered with spices and sometimes a bit of water or tomato sauce until flavorful. For shredded beef, cuts like chuck roast might be slow-cooked with spices until tender enough to shred. Tortillas are warmed (steamed, grilled, or lightly fried). The cooked beef filling is placed in the warm tortillas.</p>

    <h3>Common Variations &amp; Serving Suggestions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Variations:</strong> Countless variations exist! Different cuts of beef (steak for carne asada), cooking methods (grilled, braised, stewed), and a vast array of regional salsas and toppings make tacos incredibly diverse. Other popular taco fillings include chicken (pollo), pork (al pastor, carnitas), fish (pescado), and vegetarian options (beans, roasted vegetables).</li>
        <li><strong>Serving:</strong> Diners typically assemble their own tacos from a spread of fillings and toppings. Served with lime wedges to squeeze over for brightness.</li>

    <p><strong>A timeless Roman classic, Spaghetti Carbonara is loved for its creamy texture and rich flavor, achieved with a few simple yet quality ingredients.</strong></p>

    <h3>Origin &amp; History:</h3>
    <p>Hailing from Rome, the exact origins of Carbonara are debated. Some theories suggest it was a hearty meal for Italian charcoal workers ("carbonari"), while others link it to the Allied liberation of Rome in World War II and the availability of American eggs and bacon. Regardless of its precise beginnings, it has become a staple of Italian cuisine.</p>

    <h3>Typical Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti</li>
        <li>Guanciale (cured pork jowl) or pancetta</li>
        <li>Fresh eggs (yolks are key for richness)</li>
        <li>Pecorino Romano cheese (sometimes Parmesan or a mix)</li>
        <li>Black pepper (freshly ground)</li>
        <li>Salt (for pasta water)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preparation Summary:</h3>
    <p>Cook spaghetti until al dente. While the pasta cooks, fry the guanciale until crisp. Whisk eggs (or egg yolks) with grated Pecorino Romano cheese and a generous amount of black pepper. Drain the pasta, reserving some of the starchy cooking water. Quickly toss the hot pasta with the fried guanciale. Off the heat (to prevent scrambling the eggs), add the egg and cheese mixture, stirring vigorously. The heat from the pasta will cook the eggs into a creamy sauce. Add a little reserved pasta water if needed to achieve the desired consistency.</p>

    <h3>Common Variations &amp; Serving Suggestions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Variations:</strong> While traditionalists stick to the core ingredients, some variations include using pancetta or even bacon if guanciale is unavailable. Some recipes might incorporate a touch of garlic or a splash of white wine. Cream is generally not used in authentic Carbonara.</li>
        <li><strong>Serving:</strong> Serve immediately, topped with extra grated Pecorino Romano and a further crack of black pepper. A simple green salad can be a good accompaniment.</li>

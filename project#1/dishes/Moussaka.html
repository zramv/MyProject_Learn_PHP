    <p><strong>A rich and comforting layered casserole, Moussaka is most famously associated with Greece, featuring layers of eggplant, minced meat, and a creamy béchamel sauce.</strong></p>

    <h3>Origin &amp; History:</h3>
    <p>Layered meat and eggplant dishes are common throughout the Levant, Middle East, and Balkans. The modern Greek version, with its characteristic béchamel topping, was popularized in the 1920s by Greek chef Nikolaos Tselementes, who was influenced by French cuisine.</p>

    <h3>Typical Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggplant (aubergine), sliced and often fried or roasted</li>
        <li>Minced meat (traditionally lamb, but beef or a mix is common)</li>
        <li>Onion, garlic</li>
        <li>Tomatoes (crushed or paste)</li>
        <li>Red wine (optional, for the meat sauce)</li>
        <li>Spices: Cinnamon, allspice, oregano, parsley are common.</li>
        <li>Potatoes (sometimes used as a bottom layer)</li>
        <li><strong>For the Béchamel Sauce:</strong> Butter, flour, milk, egg yolks (for richness), grated cheese (like Kefalotyri, Parmesan, or Gruyère), a pinch of nutmeg.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preparation Summary:</h3>
    <p>Sliced eggplant is typically salted to draw out moisture, then fried or roasted until tender. The minced meat is browned with onions and garlic, then simmered with tomatoes, wine (if using), and spices to create a rich ragu. A creamy béchamel sauce is prepared. To assemble, layers of eggplant (and sometimes potato) are alternated with the meat sauce in a baking dish. The dish is then topped with a thick layer of béchamel sauce and baked until golden brown and bubbling.</p>

    <h3>Common Variations &amp; Serving Suggestions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Variations:</strong> Regional variations exist. Some versions include zucchini or other vegetables. Vegetarian moussaka replaces meat with lentils, mushrooms, or a mix of vegetables. The spices and specific cheeses used can also vary.</li>
        <li><strong>Serving:</strong> Allowed to cool slightly after baking so it holds its shape when sliced. Often served as a main course with a simple Greek salad and crusty bread.</li>
    </ul>

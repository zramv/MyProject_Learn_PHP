    <p><strong>Thailand's national dish, Pad Thai is a vibrant and flavorful stir-fried noodle dish that balances sweet, sour, salty, and umami notes.</strong></p>

    <h3>Origin &amp; History:</h3>
    <p>Pad Thai is a relatively modern dish in Thai cuisine. It was promoted in the 1930s and 1940s by the Thai government under Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram as part of a campaign to build national identity and promote rice noodle consumption.</p>

    <h3>Typical Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice noodles (thin, flat)</li>
        <li>Shrimp, chicken, tofu, or a combination</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Firm tofu (often)</li>
        <li>Bean sprouts</li>
        <li>Garlic chives (or green onions)</li>
        <li>Crushed peanuts</li>
        <li><strong>Sauce:</strong> Tamarind paste, fish sauce, palm sugar (or brown sugar), lime juice, chili flakes (optional).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preparation Summary:</h3>
    <p>Rice noodles are soaked until softened. In a hot wok or large pan, protein (shrimp, chicken, or tofu) is cooked, then pushed to one side. Eggs are scrambled on the other side of the wok. The softened noodles are added along with the prepared Pad Thai sauce. Everything is tossed together until the noodles absorb the sauce and are cooked through. Bean sprouts and garlic chives are added towards the end for a quick stir-fry to retain some crunch.</p>

    <h3>Common Variations &amp; Serving Suggestions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Variations:</strong> Can be made vegetarian or vegan by omitting animal protein and fish sauce (using soy sauce or a vegan fish sauce alternative). Different levels of spiciness can be achieved by adjusting chili.</li>
        <li><strong>Serving:</strong> Served immediately, garnished with extra crushed peanuts, fresh bean sprouts, a lime wedge for squeezing, and sometimes chili powder or flakes on the side.</li>
    </ul>
